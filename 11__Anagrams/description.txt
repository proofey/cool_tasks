According to Wikipedia, we have the following definition of an anagram:

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all 
the original letters exactly once.

For example, listen and silent are anagrams.

Implement a function called anagrams, that takes word1, word2 and returns True, if those words are anagrams and False otherwise.

We should take the following into consideration:

Casing does not matter, meaning LISTEN and silent are anagrams.
Whitespace does not matter, meaning New York Times and monkeys writting are anagrams.
Signature

anagrams("LISTEN", "silent") is True
anagrams("python", "ruby") is False
