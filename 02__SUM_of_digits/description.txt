Given an integer, implement a function, called sum_of_digits(n) that calculates the sum of n's digits.

If a negative number is given, our function should work as if it was positive.

Here's the signature:

def sum_of_digits(n):
    pass

Examples:

sum_of_digits(1325132435356) == 43
sum_of_digits(123) == 6
sum_of_digits(6) == 6
sum_of_digits(-10) == 1




Hints:

In Python, there is a special operator for integer division:

5 / 2 == 2.5
5 // 2 == 2

There's also the standard modulo division:

123 % 10 == 3
